I am an associate professor at the [Informatics Center](http://www.cin.ufpe.br),
[Federal University of Pernambuco](http://www.ufpe.br), and a member of both the academic and professional graduate programs of the
[Computer Science Department](http://www.cic.unb.br) at the [University of Brasília](http://www.unb.br), where I worked from March 2011 to December 2025.  
From August 2018 to July 2019, I was a visiting researcher at the
[University of Paderborn](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/university/), working under the supervision of
[Prof. Eric Bodden](http://www.bodden.de).

My research focuses on software maintenance and program analysis and manipulation, with the goal of identifying and fixing bugs and vulnerabilities, as well as understanding how programming language features are used in practice.

I hold B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the Federal University of Paraíba, earned in João Pessoa and Campina Grande, respectively, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Federal University of Pernambuco, in Recife.

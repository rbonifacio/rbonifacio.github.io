I am an assistant professor at the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cic.unb.br),
[University of Brasília](http://www.unb.br)
and a member of the [Software Productivity Group](http://cin.ufpe.br/spg),
led by [Prof. Paulo Borba](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~phmb/). Currently I am working as
a visiting researcher at the [University of Paderborn](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/university/) (working under
the supervision of [Prof. Eric Bodden](http://www.bodden.de)). My research focuses on
understanding the common usage of programming language features, program transformations,
software architecture and modularity, and software product lines.

I have B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from Federal University of Paraíba, respectively in João Pessoa and Campina Grande, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Federal University of Pernambuco, in Recife.

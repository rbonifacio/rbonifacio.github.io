I am an assistant professor at the Computer Science Department, University of Brasília
and a member of the [Software Productivity Group](http://cin.ufpe.br/spg),
led by [Prof. Paulo Borba](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~phmb/). Currently I am working as
a visiting research at the University of Paderborn (working under
the supervision of [Prof. Eric Bodden](http://www.bodden.de)). My research focuses on
understanding the typical usage of programming language features, program transformation,
software architecture and modularity, and software product lines.

I have B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from Federal University of Paraíba, respectively in João Pessoa and Campina Grande, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Federal University of Pernambuco, in Recife.
